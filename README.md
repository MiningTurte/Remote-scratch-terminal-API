# Remote-scratch-terminal-API
An “api” used through purely terminal/shell

Originally intended to be used by a raspberry pi, this can be used by most OS's. For raspberry pi users, setup is quite simple. Just open the file with Geany (automatically installed on most pi's) and run it. It will open "geany_run_script" and the API will load in. From there just log into your account through the API and you will be greeted with all of the current features. 

Uses TimMcCool's scratchattach library to bring some of its major features into an easy to use terminal/shell application.


I will continue to update this every once in awhile. For suggestions comment on my scratch profile which can be found here:
